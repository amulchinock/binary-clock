# Binary Clocks

This is the sort of thing you generally see people making for technical exercises.
Unfortunately, I don't have that excuse. I did this for fun, because I clearly had nothing
better to do.

I was interested in the concept of a binary clock. How would one represent time and
date data in a binary format, whilst still being relatively intuitive to the user to read,
without too much instruction.

This repo is basically a playground for that purpose. Just to experiment with various
concepts and see if there really are better ways of representing time, than we currently know.

## Running it
```
# Install dependencies
yarn global add vite@latest
yarn install

# Run Vite's dev server
vite
```

## Technical stuffs
- Vue 3, built with Vite
- **No TypeScript** (yet)
- **No unit tests** (and there probably won't ever be)
